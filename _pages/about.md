Welcome to my research homepage! <br><br>
My name is Werner Dobrautz, and I am a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellow at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg. <br><br>
My research focuses on developing innovative quantum Monte Carlo methods and novel quantum computing algorithms to enable realistic electronic structure calculations for strongly-correlated electron problems on high-performance computing hardware and near-term quantum computing devices. <br><br>
