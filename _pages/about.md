Welcome to my research homepage!
My name is Werner Dobrautz, and I am a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellow at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg. 
My research focuses on developing innovative quantum Monte Carlo methods and novel quantum computing algorithms to enable realistic quantum chemistry calculations on high-performance computing hardware and near-term quantum computing devices.

Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
