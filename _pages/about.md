My name is Werner Dobrautz and welcome to my homepage! <br><br>

After a graduate study of physics, with specialization in computational solid state physics, and a subsequent Ph.D. in computational quantum chemistry in the field of stochastic wavefunction theory for strongly correlated electron systems, I am currently a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellow at <a href='https://www.chalmers.se/en/persons/dobrautz/'>Chalmers University of Technology</a>.
<br>
I have a strong knowledge of various modern theoretical and computational quantum chemistry and physics methods. 
I acquired extensive algorithm design and development expertise as the main developer of the publicly available full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC) code <a href='https://github.com/ghb24/NECI_STABLE'>NECI</a> during my Ph.D. and consequent PostDoc.
<br>

My current research focuses on developing innovative quantum Monte Carlo methods and novel quantum computing algorithms to enable realistic electronic structure calculations for strongly correlated electron problems on high-performance computing hardware and near-term quantum computing devices. <br><br>

I have some big announcements as well as <a href='/jobs/'>job openings</a> coming out soon! Stay tuned!
