<h3>Background</h3> 

After a graduate study of physics, with specialization in computational solid state physics, and a subsequent Ph.D. in computational quantum chemistry in the field of stochastic wavefunction theory for strongly correlated electron systems, I am currently a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellow at <a href='https://www.chalmers.se/en/persons/dobrautz/'>Chalmers University of Technology</a> developing novel quantum computing algorithms to perform realistic ab initio calculations on near-term quantum computing devices. <br>
I have a strong knowledge of various modern theoretical and computational quantum chemistry and physics methods. 
I acquired extensive algorithm design and development expertise as the main developer of the publicly available full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC) code <a href='https://github.com/ghb24/NECI_STABLE'>NECI</a> during my Ph.D. and consequent PostDoc.

<h3>Research</h3>

My ongoing research focuses on three areas: (1) the development of highly accurate quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods for high-performance computing clusters to solve strongly correlated electron problems; (2) developing novel quantum computing (QC) algorithms to perform realistic electronic structure calculations on near-term intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices; and (3) a seamless integration of a hybrid HPC+QC approach to tackle relevant solid state and electronic structure problems on NISQ devices. This will pave the way to simulate strongly correlated electron systems of high scientific and economic interest, where accurate approaches are needed to understand groundbreaking physical phenomena like high-temperature superconductivity, photosynthesis, or nitrogen fixation.
