After a graduate study of physics, with specialization in computational solid state physics, and a subsequent Ph.D. in computational quantum chemistry in the field of stochastic wavefunction theory for strongly correlated electron systems, I am currently a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellow at <a href='https://www.chalmers.se/en/persons/dobrautz/'>Chalmers University of Technology</a> developing novel quantum computing algorithms to perform realistic ab initio calculations on near-term quantum computing devices. <br>
I have a strong knowledge of various modern theoretical and computational quantum chemistry and physics methods. 
I acquired extensive algorithm design and development expertise as the main developer of the publicly available full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC) code <a href='https://github.com/ghb24/NECI_STABLE'>NECI</a> during my Ph.D. and consequent PostDoc.
<br>

The two main areas of my current research are (1) the development of novel quantum computing algorithms to perform realistic ab initio calculations on near-term quantum computers as well as (2) the development of highly accurate quantum Monte Carlo methods for high-performance computing clusters to solve strongly correlated electron problems. <br><br>

The title of my Ph.D. thesis was <a href='http://dx.doi.org/10.18419/opus-10593'>'Development of FCIQMC methods for strongly correlated electron systems'</a>, supervised by <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Alavi'>Prof. Ali Alavi</a> at the <a href='https://www.fkf.mpg.de/en'>Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research</a>. The two major contributions of my work were (1) <a href='https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article/151/9/094104/197502/Efficient-formulation-of-full-configuration'>the efficient implementation of FCIQMC in a fully spin-adapted basis via the unitary group approach</a> and (2) the development and implementation of a correlated wavefunction Ansatz, the so-called transcorrelated approach, for <a href='https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.99.075119'>lattice models</a> and <a href='https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article/151/6/061101/561008'>ab initio systems.</a>
