After a graduate study of physics, with specialization in computational solid state physics, and a subsequent Ph.D. in computational quantum chemistry in the field of stochastic wavefunction theory for strongly correlated electron systems, I am currently a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellow at Chalmers University of Technology developing novel quantum computing algorithms to perform realistic ab initio calculations on near-term quantum computing devices. <br>
I have a strong knowledge of various modern theoretical and computational quantum chemistry and physics methods. 
I acquired extensive algorithm design and development expertise as the main developer of the publicly available full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC) code <a href='https://github.com/ghb24/NECI_STABLE'>NECI</a> during my Ph.D. and consequent PostDoc.
<br><br>

The two main areas of my current research are (1) the development of novel quantum computing algorithms to perform realistic ab initio calculations on near-term quantum computers as well as (2) the development of highly accurate quantum Monte Carlo methods for high-performance computing clusters to solve strongly correlated electron problems. <br><br>
