These processes, enabled by small quantum systems with strong electronic correlations, are not yet understood and pose significant challenges to experimental and theoretical investigations. Hence, there is a pressing need for sophisticated computational methods to elucidate these phenomena and support the development of green technologies. For example, artificial nitrogen fixation – converting molecular nitrogen into ammonia – at lower temperatures and pressures would offer a more sustainable alternative to the energy-intensive Haber-Bosch process, drastically reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <h4> Project </h4> <p>The successful PhD candidate (f/m/d) will be part of the interdisciplinary DRESDEN-concept Research Group <b>AI 4 Quantum</b> which is currently established at the <a href="https://www.casus.science/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Center for Advanced Systems Understanding (CASUS)</a> of the <a href="https://www.hzdr.de/db/Cms?pNid=0" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR)</a> and the <a href="https://scads.ai/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Center for Scalable Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence Dresden/Leipzig (ScaDS.AI)</a> at the <a href="https://tu-dresden.de/cids" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Center for Interdiscip­linary Digital Sciences (CIDS)</a> of the <a href="https://tu-dresden.de/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">TU Dresden</a>. In this project, you will learn to develop and apply novel deep machine learning (ML) methods, neural network and artificial intelligence approaches to extend the reach of accurate computational methods to study strongly correlated quantum matter. The focus will be the development of novel Neural Quantum States, deep learning approaches to design quantum computing (QC) algorithms, and AI and ML techniques to improve state-of-the-art quantum Monte Carlo methods.

An initial phase will be included to provide the required knowledge in electronic structure theory or ML/AI, as needed. Consequently, candidates from diverse scientific backgrounds are encouraged to apply. Key qualifications include coding experience (preferably in Python/Julia and C++ or Fortran), a strong mathematical foundation within a scientific context, and prior experience with algorithm development or implementation. Additional optional qualifications that will be considered favorably include experience in ML/AI approaches, method or algorithm development related to solve natural science problems, quantum information, or quantum computing. However, we are mainly seeking a highly motivated, committed, and enthusiastic candidate.</p> <p>Candidates are highly encouraged and welcome to suggest and pursue their own ideas within the general scope of ‘AI for Quantum Computing and Quantum Matter.’ Students will gain highly sought-after skills valued in both industry and academia, including expertise in novel machine learning/AI approaches, computational chemistry/physics, quantum algorithms, and software engineering, all within a collaborative and supportive environment. Additionally, the PI has a successful history in acquiring highly-competitive third-party funding (Marie Curie, Vinnova, BMBF), and as such we are also open and interested in assisting with future applications for competitive postdoctoral funding options.</p> <h4> About us </h4> <p>We are a newly established (since Dec. 2024) <a href="https://dresden-concept.de/dresden-concept-research-groups/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DRESDEN-concept Research Group</a> at <a href="https://www.casus.science/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">CASUS</a> of the <a href="https://www.hzdr.de/db/Cms?pNid=0" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HZDR</a> and <a href="https://scads.ai/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ScaDS.AI</a> at the <a href="https://tu-dresden.de/cids" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">CIDS</a> of the <a href="https://tu-dresden.de/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">TU Dresden</a>.
