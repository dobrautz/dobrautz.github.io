Instead of describing all possible states of a system, Monte Carlo (MC) methods rely on random numbers to sample the physically most relevant and representative ones and draw conclusions from them to understand the underlying physical properties of a system. <br>

Full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC)

<a href='https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0005754'>3</a>]
is a QMC method to solve the Schr√∂dinger equation of a system
with very high accuracy and for comparatively large system sizes.
It can obtain ground and excited states
energies

and dynamic properties[<a href='https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.121.056401'>7</a>]

or Heisenberg Hamiltonians
