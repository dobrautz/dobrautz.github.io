<a href='https://rahmlab.com/'>Martin Rahm</a> is passionate about theoretical predictions of stability, properties, and realistic routes to the synthesis of as of yet unknown materials. To this end, his group is developing frameworks and methods to further chemical thinking on topics such as chemical bonding, reactivity, chemistry under high pressure, and electronic structures of extended materials. Martin Rahm is also working on multidisciplinary origin-of-life-related questions in prebiotic chemistry and planetary science, focusing on understanding the chemical evolution of different organic polymers in the solar system. His research team is affiliated with the Wallenberg Centre for Quantum Technology (WACQT), and is developing algorithms for quantum computation of chemistry on Chalmers-build quantum processors.
