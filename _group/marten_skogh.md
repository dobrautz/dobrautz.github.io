I co-supervised Mårten in the second part of his PhD thesis, with the amazing title: <a href='https://research.chalmers.se/en/publication/538022'><i>For a Fistful of Qubits: Computational Quantum Chemistry on Near-Term Quantum Computers</i><a>. 
Mårten now is project lead at <a href='https://chalmersnextlabs.se/staff/'><i>Chalmers Next Labs</i></a> focusing on the practical application of scientific/quantum research for the benefit of society.
