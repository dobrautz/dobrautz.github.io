I supervised <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ew_Sh24AAAAJ&hl=en'>Erika</a> on her Master thesis, <a href='https://odr.chalmers.se/items/9c093b7a-ec5a-4a87-9515-3500c16b723f'><i>Combining the Transcorrelated Method with Adaptive Ansatzes for Near-term Quantum Computation</i></a> from January to June, 2023, and in the beginning of her subsequent PhD studies at Chalmers University until the end of 2024. 

Erika published her first paper: <a href='https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2024/fd/d4fd00039k'><i>Towards efficient quantum computing for quantum chemistry: reducing circuit complexity with transcorrelated and adaptive ansatz techniques</i></a> in the <a href='https://www.rsc.org/events/detail/75251/correlated-electronic-structure-faraday-discussion'><i>Faraday Discussions on Correlated electronic structure<i></a>. 
At those Faraday discussions, she and our then Master Student <a href='/group/alumni/hang'>Hang Zou</a> also won the <a href='/news/news_talk_faraday2/'>Royal Society of Chemistry Poster Prize</a> for their poster on <i>Multireference Error Mitigation to tackle Strongly Correlated Structure Problems on Quantum Hardware</i>. 

Erika remains a PhD student with <a href='https://rahmlab.com/hilda-sandstrom-2/'>Prof. Martin Rahm</a> at Chalmers University.
