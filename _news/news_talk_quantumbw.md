I had the pleasure and honor to talk at the <a href='https://www.quantumbw.de/en/'>QuantumBW Colloquium</a> at the Fraunhofer institute in Stuttgart about the potential applications (and pitfalls) of quantum computing for quantum chemistry. 


My talk was also part of the QuantumBW Autumn School. If you are interested about what I had to say, you can watch the recording <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7MsNx1GmcE'>here</a>
