Now out in Quantum - the open journal for quantum science: Together with David Fitzek, Robert J., and Christian Sch√§fer (Chalmers Physics, Chalmers University of Technology, Volvo Group, Saab), we devised a novel classical optimisation scheme combining quantum metric and momentum information to speed up the convergence of variational quantum algorithms!
