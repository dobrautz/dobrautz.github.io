I am thrilled to finally share that I have been awarded a BMBF QuantumFutur Junior Research Group Leader grant (1.8M EUR for 5 years) to establish my research group at CASUS / HZDR! ðŸŽ‰

Our research will focus on advancing quantum computing technologies within the qHPC-GREEN project, aiming to push the boundaries of quantum computing and high-performance computing for sustainable applications.
I am deeply grateful to the Bundesministerium fÃ¼r Bildung und Forschung and the hashtag#QuantumFutur Program of Quantensysteme for their support.
