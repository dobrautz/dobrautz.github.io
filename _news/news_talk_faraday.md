Today is the 2nd day of the <a href='https://www.rsc.org/events/detail/75251/correlated-electronic-structure-faraday-discussion'>Faraday Discussions on Correlated Electronic Structure</a> at the amazing venue of the Royal Society of Chemistry in the heart of London. 

I really enjoy the special format of this meeting, where all accepted papers are circulated among participants before the conference. The focus of the meeting is not on presenting your work but rather on discussing it in detail with all participants after only a short introduction. 

Today, I will discuss our work on reducing quantum circuit complexity with transcorrelated and adaptive ans√§tze to enable accurate and affordable quantum chemistry calculations on current quantum hardware. 

Led by Erika Magnusson in collaboration with Stefan Knecht and Aaron Fitzpatrick (Algorithmiq) and Martin Rahm
