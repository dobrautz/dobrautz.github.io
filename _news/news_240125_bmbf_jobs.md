I am happy to announce that we have a fully funded PhD and/or PostDoc opportunity in the general area of Quantum Computing for Quantum Chemistry in our DRESDEN-concept research group at the Center for Advanced Systems Understanding (CASUS) at HZDR of the Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR) and the ScaDS.AI Dresden/Leipzig of the CIDS – Center for Interdisciplinary Digital Sciences / Technische Universität Dresden. 

Look no further if you want to explore developing synergistic high-performance and quantum computing approaches to enable the accurate computational study of complex, strongly correlated quantum matter. 

You can find more information about our research and the specific positions on the jobs page of the homepage:
