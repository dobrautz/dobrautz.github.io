I had to pleasure to give a talk at the <a href='https://quantumconsortium.org/'>QED-C's</a> Quantum Talent Showcase <a href='https://quantumconsortium.org/poster-session/session-21/'>Session 21</a>

I talked about our recent work on how to achieve real chemical accuracy on near-term quantum devices:
