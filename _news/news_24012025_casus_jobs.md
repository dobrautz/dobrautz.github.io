I am happy to announce that we have a fully funded PhD and/or PostDoc opportunity in the general area of 
<i>Machine Learning for Quantum Computing and Simulation of Quantum Matter</i> 
in our 
<a href='https://dresden-concept.de/'>
DRESDEN-concept
</a>
research group at the 
<a href='https://www.casus.science/'>
Center for Advanced Systems Understanding (CASUS)
</a>
of the 
<a href='https://www.hzdr.de/db/Cms?pOid=44909&pNid=0&pLang=en'>
Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR)
</a>
and the 
<a href='https://scads.ai/'>
Center for Scalable Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence ScaDS.AI Dresden/Leipzig
