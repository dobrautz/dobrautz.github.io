Last Friday, I had the opportunity to present my latest research at the Quantinuum Seminar Series in Cambridge, UK. My talk, titled “Reducing the Circuit Footprint for Noise-Resilient Quantum Chemistry via Transcorrelation and Adaptive Ansätze,” focused on new techniques to enhance quantum simulations of molecular systems by mitigating noise and optimizing circuit resources.

In my presentation, I discussed how transcorrelated methods and adaptive ansätze can significantly reduce quantum circuit complexity, improving the feasibility of accurate quantum chemistry calculations on near-term hardware. The seminar series provided a fantastic platform for engaging with fellow researchers and industry professionals, fostering insightful discussions on the future of quantum computing applications in chemistry.

A big thank you to Quantinuum for hosting me and to all who attended for their thoughtful questions and discussions! Looking forward to continuing this conversation and further collaborations.
