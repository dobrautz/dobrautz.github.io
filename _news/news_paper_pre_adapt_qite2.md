I am happy to share that our recent article on <a href='https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2024/fd/d4fd00039k'>Reducing Circuit Complexity with Transcorrelated and Adaptive Ansatz Techniques</a>  has now been accepted at the <a href='https://www.rsc.org/events/detail/75251/correlated-electronic-structure-faraday-discussion'>Faraday Discussions on correlated electronic structure.</a>

Looking forward to presenting and discussing our work this July in London! 

Thanks for the great collaboration Erika Magnusson, Aaron Fitzpatrick, Stefan Knecht, Martin Rahm, Algorithmiq, Chalmers University of Technology!
