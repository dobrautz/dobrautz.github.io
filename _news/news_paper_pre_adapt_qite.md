The first preprint of our PhD, Erika Magnusson, and our contribution to the upcoming Faraday discussion in London is out! 
In collaboration with Aaron Fitzpatrick and Stefan Knecht from Algorithmiq, we combined an explicitly correlated approach in the form of the transcorrelated (TC) method with ADAPT-ive quantum circuits Ans√§tze: 

<a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16659'> arXiv:2402.16659</a>

By combining these two approaches, we can obtain more accurate results with small basis sets (=less qubits), and simultaneously require shallower quantum circuits by moving complexity from the wavefunction to the Hamiltonian.
