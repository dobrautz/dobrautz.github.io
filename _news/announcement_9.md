I had the honor and pleasure to talk at the fanciest conference site I have been to yet: the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schloss_Ringberg'>Ringberg Castle</a> of the Max Planck Society at the Tegernsee. 

Also, one of the best conference titles yet: 
QVEST - Quo Vadis Electronic Structure Theory? 

Thanks for the invitation and organization to Ali Alavi, Daniel Kats and Giovanni Li Manni from the Max-Planck Institute for Solid State Research, Stuttgart, Germany

Excellent talks by an amazing list of speakers! 

Some highlights until now: 

Giovanni Li Manni and his concept of quantum anamorphosis. 

Sandeep Sharma talked about developments and his outlook on AFQMC.

Seiichiro Ten-no presented his novel selected coupled cluster and projected TC method. 

Emmanuel Giner talked about his bi-orthonormal TC framework. 

Gustavo Scuseria talked about using dualities in electronic structure calculations. 

Joachim Brandt told us about how to FCIQMC for bosons and mixtures. 

Ke Liao talked about his new work on QICAS with Christian Schilling (in collab. with Stefan Knecht)

Sandra Luber discussed the challenges of electronic structure theory for complex catalysts. 

And Ji Chen about his deep learning approach to periodic systems. 

I'm looking forward to the next two days of talks!
