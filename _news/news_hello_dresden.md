I am finally happy to share the good news that I will start my own group as a 
<a href='https://dresden-concept.de/current/research-group-werner-dobrautz/?lang=en'>DRESDEN-concept</a> 
research group leader jointly appointed at the 
<a href='https://www.casus.science/'>Center of Advanced Systems Understanding (CASUS)</a> in Görlitz of the 
<a href='https://www.hzdr.de/db/Cms?pNid=0'>Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf</a> 
and the 
<a href='https://scads.ai/'>Center for Scalable Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence Dresden/Leipzig</a>
at the 
<a href='https://tu-dresden.de/'>TU Dresden. 

I am building an AI4Quantum research group that focuses on developing a synergistic HPC+QC approach aided by novel artificial intelligence/deep machine learning methods to enable the computational study of complex quantum systems relevant to the green energy transition. 
I am very much looking forward to the opportunity and stay tuned for future PhD and Postdoc openings!
