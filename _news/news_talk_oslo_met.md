I had the opportunity to lecture about <b>hybrid quantum algorithms applied to quantum chemistry problems</b> at <a href='https://www.oslomet.no/'>OsloMet</a>– Oslo Metropolitan University's <a href='https://uni.oslomet.no/quantum/upcoming-school-on-quantum-computing/'>Autumn School on Quantum Computing</a>, which took place at a lovely venue close to the legendary Holmenkollen ski-jumping arena in Oslo. 

There have been very interesting lectures on Quantum Channels and Noise Models by Alexander Müller-Hermes and Quantum Reservoir Computing by Rodrigo Martines Peña. Looking forward to the remaining lectures! 

Many thanks to Sølve Selstø, Sergey Denisov, and Andre Laestadius for the organization and invitation!
