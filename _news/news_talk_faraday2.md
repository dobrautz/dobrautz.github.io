As a nice finale to the inspiring Faraday Discussions on Correlated Electronic Structure, our PhD Erika Magnusson won the RSC Poster Prize for her and our Master student Hang Zou's poster on:
'Multireference Error Mitigation to tackle Strongly Correlated Structure Problems on Quantum Hardware' 

Stay tuned for an upcoming publication on that! 

Thanks to George Booth and Ali Alavi for organising this amazing event!
